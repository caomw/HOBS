Emerging head-worn computing devices can enable hands-free interactions with smart objects in physical spaces.

We introduce and characterize a method for selecting and interacting with physical targets at a distance using head orientation. We augment a commercial wearable device, Google Glass, with an infrared (IR) emitter to select targets equipped with IR receivers. We present our iterative design process that has shown with IR, it outperforms a pure list selection. And with IR intensity, the time can be further reduced. If head motion is added, we can infer a spatial data structure of the nodes to enable a natural head-motion based disambiguation.
We demonstrate an application of our selection technique for controlling smart appliances and report qualitative user impressions.
