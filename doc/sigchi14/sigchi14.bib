	abstract = {As wireless devices increasingly becoming ubiquitous, spontaneous interaction opportunities are accordingly becoming common. Although spontaneous interaction research has been ongoing for many years, a key question of spontaneous interaction still remains open: how can users associate devices in a natural, intuitive and secure manner. Over the past decade, researchers have demonstrated a plethora of device association techniques. Nonetheless, users were often neglected during design or they were only involved in a later stage, like testing. We argue that since device association is performed by end-users, usability factors need to be considered in the early stage of design. In this article, we present a categorisation of factors that influence the usability of device association. This paper aims at providing a framework that informs researchers and system designers of the considerations needed when designing or adopting an association technique.},

	abstract = {We present a novel interface for human-robot interaction that enables a human to intuitively and unambiguously select a {3D} location in the world and communicate it to a mobile robot. The human points at a location of interest and illuminates it (``clicks it'') with an unaltered, off-the-shelf, green laser pointer. The robot detects the resulting laser spot with an omnidirectional, catadioptric camera with a narrow-band green filter. After detection, the robot moves its stereo pan/tilt camera to look at this location and estimates the location's {3D} position with respect to the robot's frame of reference. Unlike previous approaches, this interface for gesture-based pointing requires no instrumentation of the environment, makes use of a non-instrumented everyday pointing device, has low spatial error out to 3 meters, is fully mobile, and is robust enough for use in real-world applications. We demonstrate that this human-robot interface enables a person to designate a wide variety of everyday objects placed throughout a room. In 99.4\% of these tests, the robot successfully looked at the designated object and estimated its {3D} position with low average error. We also show that this interface can support object acquisition by a mobile manipulator. For this application, the user selects an object to be picked up from the floor by ``clicking'' on it with the laser pointer interface. In 90\% of these trials, the robot successfully moved to the designated object and picked it up off of the floor.},

	abstract = {It is difficult to interact with computer displays that are across the room. A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but interaction techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and slow. Although many previous papers discuss laser pointer interaction techniques, none seem to have performed user studies to help inform the design. This paper reports on two studies of laser pointer interactions that answer some of the questions related to interacting with objects using a laser pointer. The first experiment evaluates various parameters of laser pointers. For example, the time to acquire a target is about 1 second, and the jitter due to hand unsteadiness is about ±8 pixels, which can be reduced to about ±2 to ±4 pixels by filtering. We compared 7 different ways to hold various kinds of laser pointers, and found that a laser pointer built into a {PalmOS} device was the most stable. The second experiment compared 4 different ways to select objects on a large projected display. We found that tapping directly on a wall-size {SmartBoard} was the fastest and most accurate method, followed by a new interaction technique that copies the area of interest from the big screen to a handheld. Third in speed was the conventional mouse, and the laser pointer came in last, with a time almost twice as long as tapping on the {SmartBoard}},

The enabling technology is a wireless tag which acts as a radio frequency identity and geometry ({RFIG)} transponder. We show how addition of a photo-sensor to a wireless tag significantly extends its functionality to allow geometric operations - such as finding the {3D} position of a tag, or detecting change in the shape of a tagged object. Tag data is presented to the user by direct projection using a handheld locale-aware mobile projector. We introduce a novel technique that we call interactive projection to allow a user to interact with projected information e.g. to navigate or update the projected {information.The} ideas are demonstrated using objects with active radio frequency ({RF)} tags. But the work was motivated by the advent of unpowered passive-{RFID}, a technology that promises to have significant impact in real-world applications. We discuss how our current prototypes could evolve to passive-{RFID} in the future.},
