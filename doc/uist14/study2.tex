\section{Study2: Benefits of IR Intensity refinement}
\bjoern{write this with analogous structure as study 1 and focus on the comparisons we discussed:
1) Chi-square test of required refinement dialogs; 2) chi-square of number of times the first item in the UI was appropriate; 3) t-test of selection times; 4) comparison of error rates (likely, IR will be higher - that's the price to pay for a smarter technique).}
