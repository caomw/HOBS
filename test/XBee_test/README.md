## Introduction
This folder contains the code to set the XBee chip. It's named XBee_test because we could simply modify this code to test if the XBee radio works or not.

## Run
To run the code, simply attach the XBee radio to an Arduino Uno, with pin 3, 2 used for Arduino RX/TX (XBee TX/RX). Then open Arduino Serial Monitor to see what's happening.
