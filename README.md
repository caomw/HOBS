HOBS
===============

Emerging head-worn computing devices can enable interactions with smart objects
in physical spaces. We present the iterative design and evaluation of HOBS - a
head-orientation based selection method for interacting with these devices at a
distance. We augment a commercial wearable device, Google Glass, with an
infrared (IR) emitter to select targets equipped with IR receivers. Our first
design shows that a naive IR implementation can outperform list selection, but
has poor performance when refinement between multiple tar- gets is needed. A
second design uses IR intensity measurement at targets to improve refinement. To
address the lack of natural mapping of on-screen target lists to spatial target
location, our third design infers a spatial data structure of the targets
enabling a natural head-motion based disambiguation. Finally, we demonstrate a
universal remote control application using HOBS and report qualitative user
impressions.
