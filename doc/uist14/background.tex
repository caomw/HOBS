%% Bjoern: I would mostly rely on prior literature here. There are neck-controlled joysticks for users with disabilities that are probably useful to look at. see below.
 
%% YL: I also think we should briefly cover how people used to detect head-orientatation. I don't have references at hand and the only paper I can recall is Michel's paper. I think Pourang Irani has papers in this area too. Overall I think previous ways are too heavyweight. In comparison, your way of acquiring head orientation is more effective and lightweight.

%In this section, we will first provide some background about human's neck muscle kinectics. Given that constrain, we think the right way to achieve head-orientation based targeting should be using the area selection technique. This motivates our selection of using IR to capture users' head orientation and also the carefully design of the disambiguation technique.
