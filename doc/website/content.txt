Abstract:
We introduce a novel method for selecting and controlling smart appliances in physical spaces through a head-worn computing device with near-eye display and wireless communication. We augment a commercial wearable computing device, Google Glass, with a narrow-beam IR emitter for this purpose. This configuration yields a usable beam width of 2 to 4 feet (60 to 120cm) for targeting at room scale. We describe a disambiguation technique if infrared targeting hits multi ple targets simultaneously. A target acquisition study with 14 participants shows that selection using head orientation with our device outperforms list selection on a wearable device. We also report qualitative data from using our device to control multiple appliances in a smart home scenario.

Motivation:

Increasingly, devices and services in our built environment are networked and can be controlled remotely. The proliferation of smart, controllable devices such as intelligent lighting, AV equipment, HVAC systems, or kitchen appliances raises the question of how to best interact with them. Existing approaches are usually first browse a list of all available devices and then call up a device-specific user interface.

We focus on the "addressing" step -- how users select the right target to interact.


our solution, we attempt to address the naming and
scaling challenges faced by handheld mobile devices.
